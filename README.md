# BasicScilabForControlSystems

This is a lab manual on using Scilab for Control Systems.
Here you will find an introduction on solving Control System
problems using Scilab, instead of traditional use of Matlab.

Its use is for academic purposes, though anyone may use.
This manual simply is a little on my part for using Scilab
in such applications, within our institutions. Hope others
follow and improve upon this work. It is definitely incomplete
and requires reviews and corrections.

While working on this manual, I realized that using this I
could have a template of questions to use programming
languages/Packages other than Scilab to solve them.
That way, it would allow anyone to use those language
specific manual to use them or refer to them. But then I
certainly don't have the expertise on tackling other
languages for this purpose.

So call upon all those who can help in this task.
### Help correct & extend this manual

Though I would love to see the following languages being
adopted:
	- python
	- Java
	- C++
	- C#

I certainly don't know how capable other languages are, not
even those that I have listed as my wish list.

[Note: I am aware that there are resources, on the internet,
 on how to computationally solve Control System problems, but
 having a format of this manual as basis for academic use is
 quite useful, and a repertoire of other languages is even
 better.]

Following are the topics covered in this manual:

1   Introduction to Matrix and Polynomial operations
2   Introduction to basic plotting and control flow techniques
3   Introduction to Control System Toolbox
4   System Design using Control System Toolbox
5   System Modelling in Simulink
9   Simulation of second order model of a motor
10  Using MATLAB and GUI based SISO Tool for root locus

Topics 6, 7 and 8 were excluded as they were not related to Scilab directly.
